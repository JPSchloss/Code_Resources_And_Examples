Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
============================================

This document contains information about machine learning and artificial intelligence.
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms
that can learn from data without being explicitly programmed.

Key concepts in machine learning include:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning  
- Reinforcement learning
- Neural networks
- Deep learning

Applications of AI include natural language processing, computer vision,
robotics, and autonomous systems.
